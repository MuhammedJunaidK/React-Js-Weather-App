# React-Js-Weather-App
The Weather App is a simple and user-friendly web application that provides real-time weather information for any location worldwide. It allows users to quickly check the current weather conditions, temperature, and other essential weather details of a specific city or place.


Key Features:

‣Search Functionality: The app features a search bar where users can input the name of a city or location. Upon pressing the "Enter" key, the app retrieves weather data for the specified location.

‣Weather Information Display: Once the user enters a location, the app fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API and displays key weather information such as temperature, weather condition (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.), and an appropriate weather icon.

‣Additional Weather Details: The app provides additional weather details, including "Feels Like" temperature, humidity percentage, and wind speed. These details give users a comprehensive understanding of the weather conditions at the selected location.

‣User-Friendly Design: The Weather App features a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to navigate and access weather information seamlessly.


How it Works:

‣Upon opening the app, users are presented with a search bar where they can enter the desired location.

‣After typing the location and pressing "Enter," the app sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data for the specified location.

‣The app then parses the received data and displays essential weather information, including temperature, weather condition, and an appropriate weather icon.

‣Additional weather details, such as "Feels Like" temperature, humidity percentage, and wind speed, are also shown to provide users with a comprehensive view of the weather conditions.
